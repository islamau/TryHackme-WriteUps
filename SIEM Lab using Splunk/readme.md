In this project, I utilized Splunk to build a home-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab, where I conducted in-depth security monitoring, anomaly detection, and incident handling. The project was designed to simulate real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) activities and develop hands-on experience with Splunk's powerful capabilities in security operations.

Key Activities:
    
  1. SIEM Setup and Configuration: Configured Splunk as a centralized SIEM tool, integrating data sources to collect and analyze logs from multiple devices in my home network.
  2. Anomaly Detection and Investigation: Developed searches and custom dashboards to identify unusual patterns in network traffic, system activity, and user behavior. Investigated anomalies using Splunk's advanced search capabilities, including SPL (Search Processing Language).
  3. Incident Handling: Simulated security incidents such as unauthorized access attempts and network breaches. Used Splunk to monitor, detect, and respond to incidents by creating alerts, correlating log data, and generating reports.
  4. Log Analysis and Reporting: Analyzed logs from various sources, such as firewalls and endpoints, to detect potential threats. Generated detailed reports to document investigation findings and incident response efforts.

Tools and Techniques:

    Splunk for log collection, analysis, and incident response.
    Custom SPL Queries to monitor and filter anomalies.
    Alerts and Dashboards for real-time monitoring and quick threat identification.
    Incident Response Procedures to handle detected security events.

This hands-on experience with Splunk in a home lab environment helped refine my skills in SIEM management, anomaly detection, and incident handling, preparing me for real-world cybersecurity challenges.
