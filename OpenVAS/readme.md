# Analyzing OpenVAS Scan Reports

This write-up presents my analysis of solving the Practical Vulnerability Management task in TryHackMe's OpenVAS room, using a provided OpenVAS vulnerability scan report. The aim of this write-up is to showcase how to effectively integrate OpenVAS into a cybersecurity workflow to analyze vulnerabilities, identify potential attack vectors, and solve CTF challenges.

### Key Outcomes:
1. Reporting & Monitoring: Gaining insights into interpreting reports and the importance of continuous monitoring for security posture management.
2. Vulnerability Management: Applying OpenVAS scan results to real-world scenarios, emphasizing the role of structured analysis in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.
